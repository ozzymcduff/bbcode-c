# BBCode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wallymathieu/bbcode-c.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wallymathieu/bbcode-c)

This version of BBCode is simply to try out the concept. It was originally
a c# version written one weekend. If you need a c version you should
probably turn to a mature library (this code has never been in 
production). The c# version was written when there wasn't any good and
performant library. This has probably changed.
